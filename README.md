# Bike_Sales_Dashboard
**Project Description**

In this project, I evaluated the bike sales data to understand different factors that are considered by the customers before making a purchase decision. For implementing this, I created pivot tables in Excel to understand how different factors such as income, gender, education, marital status, regions, etc. are correlated to each other. The main objective of this project is to create a dashboard using Excel to analyze bike sales count data across various regions, occupations, and different factors which affects the demand for bike.
Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
